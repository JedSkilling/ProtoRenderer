-   Triangles were stored in one list that was preserved, in future triangle list should be dynamically generated from cube OBJECTS, need to make proper classes for cubes ect
-   Better way of preventing triangle overlap
-   Make orientation of system clear and consistent
-   Clearer division of code in classes, better function splitting
-   Use inheritance for basic data like position, velocity and collision checks
