-   Triangles were stored in one list that was preserved
    a   In future triangle list should be dynamically generated from cube OBJECTS, need to make proper classes for cubes ect
    b   This should allow for moving objects to be kept together
-   Better way of preventing triangle overlap
-   Make orientation of system clear and consistent
-   Clearer division of code in classes, better function splitting
-   Use inheritance for basic data like position, velocity and collision checks
    a   Proper physics with collision checking
